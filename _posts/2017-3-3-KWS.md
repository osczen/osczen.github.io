title: Building a system for Keyword Spotting

**What is Keyword Spotting (KWS)?**

The basic task of keyword spotting is quite simple: the goal is to identify segments of human speech where a particular word or phrase was mentioned. It is easy to see why this might be uesful -- we can use this to identify sections of a recorded lecture where a particular topic was discussed or use it to automatically count the number of times the word "yuge" was used in one of Donald Trump's speeches. The KWS problem can be distinguished between two settings: an "online" or an "offline" settting. In an "online" setting, we are interested in findings "hits" for real-time speech. In an "offline" setting, we want to find the hits for speech that has already been transcribed by a speech-to-text system. Most practical applications occur in the latter setting, so that will be the focus of this tutorial.


**Architecture of a KWS system**

The basic architecture of a KWS system consists of the following:

-- a set of files containing the transcribed speech
-- an index used for searching over the transcribed speech
