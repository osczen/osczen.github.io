Master student at Cambridge University in the Machine Learning, Speech, and Language Technologies course.

### More Information
Before that, I was an undergraduate CS specialist at the University of Toronto, St. George with a focus in artificial intelligence (AI). My main interests in AI are problems in reinforcement learning/machine learning, natural language processing and planning under uncertainty. I also like to dabble in topics in programming languages from time to time. I am interested in the interplay between AI and human psychology, and how our understanding of the human mind can be improved based on advances made in AI. Moreover, I am interested in how intelligent behaviour can be described within a computational framework.
