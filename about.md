Master student at Cambridge University in the Machine Learning, Speech, and Language Technologies course.

### More Information
Before that, I was an undergraduate CS specialist at the University of Toronto, St. George with a focus in artificial intelligence. My main interests in AI are problems in reinforcement learning/machine learning, natural language processing and planning under uncertainty. I also like to dabble in topics in programming languages from time to time. Generally speaking, I am interested in the interplay between general artificial intelligence and human psychology, and how advances in AI can be made by drawing from observations of how the human mind operates; moreover, I am interested in how these "intelligent processes" can be described using concrete computational models.
